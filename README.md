The first goal that we wanted to achieve was tracking the speed of the car by counting tire rotations. For this we used a potientometer to be able to control the amount of rotations that the car made. 
Next we wanted to make a speed versus time chart, we did this by serial monitor communication.
Lastly, we wanted to track the total distance that the car has traveled. We did this by mathematically computing the tire rotations to how long the car has been running. 
By doing all of these tasks, we believe that our car will be safer and more modern.
